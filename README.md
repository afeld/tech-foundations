# Operations Management in IT course

This repository uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to set up Google Cloud for the Columbia University's [Operations Management in IT](https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/#subj/TMGT/PS5120-20241-001/) course. Using a list of student IDs (UNIs), it provisions [Projects](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview#projects) for each, granting access to the instructor and Associates (a.k.a. teaching assistants).

Using credits through the [Google Cloud for Education](https://cloud.google.com/edu/faculty) program, students will:

1. Redeem their credits (information sent through the instructor)
1. [Set the billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#how-to-change-ba)
